# Project 1 Generative Text

Ellie Kripal, ekripal2@unl.edu

## Abstract

In this project, I plan on taking transcripts of various TedTalks found from YouTube. Using this, I will train the program to print out a new TedTalk, that I will then perform and film in standard TedTalk fashion. I want to use a plethora of types of TedTalks, including a randomized category, self help catgory, and "unique story" category. I also want to play with different types of TedTalks, like TedX and TedEd.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference
